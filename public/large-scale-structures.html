            <h2>A brief Introduction</h2>
            <br/>
            The Universe from a lens that covers vast spaces ~ 100 Mpc across and beyond is homogeneous and isotropic. That means when one looks through this lens anywhere towards any direction one will observe the same view indistinguishable from one another. But when we step down on smaller scales, the Universe contains density fluctuation ranging from subatomic quantum fluctuations up to the large superclusters and voids, ~ 50 Mpc across. The spatial cosmic matter distribution on these scales displays a salient and pervasive foamlike pattern. From the efforts of redshift survey campaigns, it has completely revised our view of the matter distribution on these cosmological scales. The weblike spatial arrangement of galaxies and mass into elongated filaments, sheetlike walls and dense compact clusters, the existence of large near-empty void regions and the hierarchical nature of this mass distribution – marked by substructure over a wide range of scales and densities – are three major characteristics of we have come to know as the Cosmic Web.

EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) is a suite of cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations aimed at understanding how galaxies form and evolve. The largest simulation models the formation of structures in a volume of 100 Megaparsecs on a side (over 300 million light-years). This is large enough to contain 10,000 galaxies of the size of the Milky Way or larger. Smaller volumes have been modeled with different subgrid models for unresolved physical processes and/or higher resolution. [Source: The Virgo Consortium, Schaye et al.]</figcaption>

            Computer simulations suggest that the observed cellular patterns are a prominent and natural aspect of cosmic structure formation through gravitational instability (Peebles, 1980), the standard paradigm for the emergence of structure in our Universe. Structure in the Universe is the result of the gravitational growth of tiny density perturbations and the accompanying tiny velocity perturbations in the primordial Universe. Supported by an impressive body of evidence, primarily those of temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (Smoot et al., 1992; Bennett et al., 2003; Spergel et al., 2006), the character of the primordial random density and velocity perturbation field is that of a homogeneous and isotropic spatial Gaussian process. Such fields of primordial Gaussian perturbations in the gravitational potential are a natural product of an early inflationary phase of our Universe.

            <h2>The Matthew Effect</h2>
            <br/>
            The basic machanism for growing large structures, such as voids and superclusters, is gravitational instability. The early universe had slight inhomogeneities in its density. We know this density fluctuations existed at the time of last scattering by looking at the cosmic microwave background. When the universe is matter dominated, the overdense regions expand less rapidly then the universe as a whole. If the densities of these regions are sufficiently great, they will collapse and become gravitationally bound objects such as clusters. The dense clusters will, in addition, draw matter to themselves from the surrounding underdense regions. The effect of gravity on density fluctuations is called the Matthew effect.
            <br/><br/>

    

            <h2>Gravitational Instability</h2>
            <br/>
            The formation of structures in the Universe is a very complex phenomena which is not yet entirely understood. The initiation is a fluid dynamical process caused by a gravitational instability. This leads to the initially uniform interstellar medium into break into clumps.<br/><br/>

            Imagine initially there is a unifromly distributed gas and due to some disturbance at a certain region there is a compression. Acoustic waves would be created by the excess pressure in this compressed area. It will spread the compression in other areas as the gas return to its original uniform state. But at the compressed region there is also an enhanced gravitational attraction and thus will try to pull more gas into the compressed region. Here at this moment whether the acoustic waves win over the enhanced gravity or gravity wins will decide the fate on how the system is going to evolve. It can be demonstrated that greater gravity is not as significant and that acoustic waves take over if the region of compression is tiny. The greater gravity in the zone of compression, on the other hand, may outweigh the acoustic waves if the region of compression is larger than a critical size, drawing more material into the area and leading to an instability. James Jeans is the first person to demonstrate the existence of this instability. In his honour this phenomenais popularly known as <i>Jeans Instability</i>.<br/><br/>

            <h3>Jeans Mass</h3>
            <br/>
            The Jeans mass is the critical mass where the gravitational force and the internal pressure of molecular clouds are in equilibrium with each other. Jeans mass is often denoted by \(M_J\) and it's expression is given as

            $$ M_J = {4\over3}\pi\lambda_J^3\rho_o  $$

            where \(\rho_o\) is gas density and \(\lambda_J\) is Jeans length. Jeans length is expressed as

            $$ \lambda_J = {C_s\over(G\rho_o)^{1/2}} $$

            where \(C_s\) is gaseous isothermal sound speed and \(G\) is the Gravitational constant.

            If the mass of the molecular clouds is larger than the Jeans mass than it results in a collapse on itself i.e. the gravitational forces will overcome the internal pressure/thermal expansion energy. If it is equal to the Jeans mass than the resulting equilibrium holds the structure to stay in a stable state.<br/><br/>

            <h2>Redshift Surveys</h2>
            <br/>


            <h3>The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey</h3>
            <br/>
            The Two-degree-Field Galaxy Redshift Survey is a redshift survey conducted by the Australian Astronomical Observatory with the 3.9m Anglo-Australian Telescope between 1997 and 11 April 2002. The image shown below shows the data from this survey. As also seen in the image the image, the survey determined the large scale structure in two slices of the Universe toa depth of around 2.5 billion light years and \(\sim 0.2\) redshift.

            </figure>


            The main achievements from the 2dF survey include The measurement of the density parameter of non-relativistic matter, The detection of Baryon acoustic oscillations, and as a consequence the relationship between the density of baryonic matter and dark matter, limits on the contribution of massive neutrinos to dark matter and thus as a result putting a limit on the sum of the masses of the three families of neutrinos at 1.8 eV. All of these results agrees with other measurements from other project/missions, particularly with WMAP which provides confidence for the current standard cosmological model.
